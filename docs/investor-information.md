        this.targetInflation = 0.02; // 2% target inflation
        this.maxInflation = 0.08; // 8% maximum inflation
        this.minInflation = 0.01; // 1% minimum inflation
    }
    
    calculateInflationRate(networkMetrics) {
        const {
            transactionVolume,
            stakingParticipation,
            networkGrowth,
            marketConditions
        } = networkMetrics;
        
        // Base inflation adjustment
        let inflationRate = this.targetInflation;
        
        // Adjust based on network usage
        if (transactionVolume > this.targetVolume) {
            inflationRate *= 0.95; // Reduce inflation if high usage
        } else {
            inflationRate *= 1.05; // Increase inflation if low usage
        }
        
        // Adjust based on staking participation
        if (stakingParticipation > this.targetStaking) {
            inflationRate *= 0.98; // Reduce inflation if high staking
        } else {
            inflationRate *= 1.02; // Increase inflation if low staking
        }
        
        // Adjust based on network growth
        inflationRate *= (1 + networkGrowth * 0.1);
        
        // Apply bounds
        inflationRate = Math.max(this.minInflation, Math.min(this.maxInflation, inflationRate));
        
        return inflationRate;
    }
