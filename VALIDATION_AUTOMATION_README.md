```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Test environment
export NODE_ENV=test

# Validation directory
export KALDRIX_TEST_DIR=/tmp/kaldrix-test

# Database configuration (if needed)
export DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
```

### Test Configuration
Validation parameters can be adjusted in the respective test scripts:

- **Fee thresholds**: `scripts/test-fees.sh`
- **Staking parameters**: `scripts/test-staking-rewards.sh`
- **Governance settings**: `scripts/test-governance.sh`
- **Performance targets**: `scripts/test-performance.sh`

## 🔧 Custom Test Creation

### Creating New Test Scripts
1. Create a new test script in the `scripts/` directory
2. Source the common utilities: `source "$(dirname "$0")/common-test-utils.sh"`
3. Use the provided helper functions for consistency
4. Add the script to `package.json` for easy execution

### Example Test Structure
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/test-custom-feature.sh

source "$(dirname "$0")/common-test-utils.sh"

test_custom_feature() {
    echo "Testing Custom Feature..."
    
    local test_result=$(node -e "
        // Your test logic here
        console.log(JSON.stringify({ success: true }));
    ")
    
    if echo "$test_result" | grep -q '"success":true'; then
        test_passed "Custom Feature"
        return 0
    else
        test_failed "Custom Feature"
        return 1
    fi
}

# Main execution
case "${1:-all}" in
    "feature")
        test_custom_feature
        ;;
    *)
        echo "Usage: $0 {feature}"
        exit 1
        ;;
esac
```

### Adding to Package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:economic:custom": "./scripts/test-custom-feature.sh"
  }
}
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Test Failures Due to Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database
npm run db:reset

# Check database connection
npm run db:push
```

#### 2. Memory Issues During Testing
```bash
# Increase Node.js memory limit
export NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096"

# Run tests with increased memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" npm run validation
```

#### 3. Timeout Issues
```bash
# Run validation with extended timeout
export KALDRIX_TEST_TIMEOUT=60000  # 60 seconds
npm run validation
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
# Enable debug logging
export DEBUG=kaldrix:*

# Run tests with verbose output
npm run validation 2>&1 | tee validation-debug.log
```

## 📈 Performance Metrics

### Target Performance Levels
- **Throughput**: 75,000+ TPS (Transactions Per Second)
- **Response Time**: < 50ms average for economic operations
- **Memory Usage**: < 1GB for standard operations
- **Success Rate**: > 99% for all operations

### Monitoring Test Performance
```bash
# Monitor system resources during testing
top -p $(pgrep -f "node.*validation")

# Check memory usage
ps -o rss= -p $(pgrep -f "node.*validation") | awk '{print $1/1024 "MB"}'

# Monitor disk I/O
iostat -dx 1
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Test Environment Security
- Use test-only blockchain addresses
- Never use production private keys in tests
- Isolate test databases from production
- Clean up test data after validation

### Adversarial Test Safety
- All adversarial tests are simulated and safe
- No actual funds or assets are at risk
- Tests use mock data and simulated scenarios
- Network isolation prevents external impact

## 📝 Best Practices

### Running Validation
1. **Always run full validation** before deploying to production
2. **Check resource usage** during performance tests
3. **Review adversarial test results** for security implications
4. **Keep test data updated** to reflect current system state

### Test Development
1. **Use provided helper functions** for consistency
2. **Include proper error handling** in all tests
3. **Add meaningful assertions** to validate expected behavior
4. **Document test scenarios** and expected outcomes

### Report Analysis
1. **Review success rates** for all test categories
2. **Pay attention to performance metrics** and trends
3. **Address failed tests** before proceeding
4. **Implement recommendations** from validation reports

## 🤝 Contributing
