## Core Components

### 4.1 DAG Core

The DAG Core implements a novel directed acyclic graph structure optimized for quantum resistance and high throughput.

#### Transaction Structure

```rust
struct Transaction {
    id: Hash256,                    // PQC-secured hash
    sender: PublicKey,              // Post-quantum public key
    receiver: PublicKey,            // Post-quantum public key
    amount: u64,                    // Transaction amount
    nonce: u64,                     // Anti-replay counter
    timestamp: u64,                 // Unix timestamp
    parents: Vec<Hash256>,         // References to parent transactions
    signature: Signature,           // PQC digital signature
    quantum_proof: QuantumProof,    // Quantum resistance proof
    metadata: Option<Vec<u8>>,      // Optional metadata
}
```

#### DAG Node Structure

```rust
struct DAGNode {
    transaction: Transaction,       // Transaction data
    children: Vec<Hash256>,        // References to child transactions
    weight: u64,                   // Node weight for consensus
    confidence: f64,               // Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
    status: NodeStatus,            // Node status (pending, confirmed, finalized)
    quantum_score: u32,            // Quantum resistance score
}
```

#### Core Algorithms

**DAG Construction Algorithm**
```
function addTransaction(newTx):
    // Validate transaction structure
    if !validateTransaction(newTx):
        return Error("Invalid transaction")
    
    // Select parent transactions using tip selection algorithm
    parents = selectParents(newTx)
    
    // Attach transaction to DAG
    newTx.parents = parents
    
    // Update parent references
    for parent in parents:
        dag[parent].children.append(newTx.id)
    
    // Calculate initial node weight
    newTx.weight = calculateInitialWeight(newTx)
    
    // Perform quantum resistance validation
    if !validateQuantumResistance(newTx):
        return Error("Quantum resistance validation failed")
    
    // Add to DAG
    dag[newTx.id] = DAGNode(newTx)
    
    // Propagate to network
    propagateTransaction(newTx)
    
    return Success(newTx.id)
```

**Tip Selection Algorithm**
```
function selectParents(newTx):
    // Get all unconfirmed transactions (tips)
    tips = getUnconfirmedTransactions()
    
    // Calculate cumulative weights
    for tip in tips:
        tip.cumulativeWeight = calculateCumulativeWeight(tip)
    
    // Apply weighted random walk
    selectedParents = []
    for i in range(PARENT_COUNT):
        currentTip = weightedRandomWalk(tips)
        selectedParents.append(currentTip.id)
    
    return selectedParents
```

- **Confirmation Time**: 2-5 seconds
- **Storage Efficiency**: Optimized for sparse DAG representation
- **Memory Usage**: Linear growth with network size

### 4.2 Prime Layer

The Prime Layer implements a novel mathematical framework based on prime number properties to provide quantum-resistant validation and consensus.

#### Mathematical Foundation

**Prime Number-Based Hashing**
```
PHash(x) = ∏(p_i^e_i) mod N
where:
- p_i are distinct prime numbers
- e_i are exponents derived from input x
- N is a large composite modulus
```

**Quantum-Resistant Signature Scheme**
```
Key Generation:
- Select large primes p, q where p ≡ q ≡ 3 mod 4
- Compute N = p × q
- Private key: (p, q)
- Public key: N

Signing:
- For message m, compute hash h = PHash(m)
- Find x such that x² ≡ h mod N
- Signature: (x, h')

Verification:
- Verify x² ≡ h' mod N
- Verify h' = PHash(m)
```

#### Validator Logic

**Prime Validator Algorithm**
```rust
struct PrimeValidator {
    public_key: PublicKey,
    private_key: PrivateKey,
    prime_base: u64,           // Base prime for this validator
    stake_amount: u64,        // Staked amount
    reputation_score: f64,    // Reputation score (0.0-1.0)
    last_validation: u64,      // Last validation timestamp
    quantum_keys: QuantumKeyPair, // PQC key pair
}

impl PrimeValidator {
    fn validate_transaction(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Result<bool, Error> {
        // Verify quantum-resistant signature
        if !self.verify_quantum_signature(tx) {
            return Err(Error::InvalidSignature);
        }
        
        // Check prime-based hash validity
        if !self.validate_prime_hash(tx) {
            return Err(Error::InvalidPrimeHash);
        }
        
        // Verify transaction structure
        if !self.validate_structure(tx) {
            return Err(Error::InvalidStructure);
        }
        
        // Check for double-spending
        if self.detect_double_spend(tx) {
            return Err(Error::DoubleSpend);
        }
        
        Ok(true)
    }
    
    fn verify_quantum_signature(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> bool {
        // Implement PQC signature verification
        // Uses lattice-based cryptography
        let signature = &tx.signature;
        let message = self.hash_transaction(tx);
        
        // Dilithium signature verification
        dilithium_verify(&self.public_key, &message, signature)
    }
    
    fn validate_prime_hash(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> bool {
        // Prime-based hash validation
        let computed_hash = self.compute_prime_hash(tx);
        let expected_hash = &tx.quantum_proof.prime_hash;
        
        computed_hash == *expected_hash
    }
    
    fn compute_prime_hash(&self, tx: &Transaction) -> Hash256 {
        // Compute hash using prime number properties
        let input = self.hash_transaction(tx);
        let mut result = 1u64;
        
        // Use prime number transformation
        for (i, byte) in input.iter().enumerate() {
            let prime = self.get_nth_prime(*byte as usize);
            result = result.wrapping_mul(prime);
        }
        
        Hash256::from_u64(result)
    }
}
```

#### Mathematical Formulas

**Prime Number Weight Function**
```
W(t) = ∏(p_i | p_i divides H(t) + t.nonce)
where:
- H(t) is the transaction hash
- t.nonce is the transaction nonce
- p_i are prime factors
```

**Quantum Resistance Score**
```
QR(t) = min(1, log_p(H(t)) / λ)
where:
- p is the smallest prime factor of H(t)
- λ is the security parameter (typically 128)
```

**Consensus Threshold**
```
Threshold = (2/3) × Total_Stake × Prime_Factor
where:
- Total_Stake is the sum of all validator stakes
- Prime_Factor is the product of active validator primes
```

### 4.3 Consensus Mechanism

The consensus mechanism combines DAG-based ordering with Byzantine fault tolerance, enhanced by prime number mathematics for quantum resistance.

#### Hybrid Consensus Algorithm

**DAG-Based Ordering**
```
function orderTransactions():
    // Get all unconfirmed transactions
    unconfirmed = getUnconfirmedTransactions()
    
    // Calculate cumulative weights
    for tx in unconfirmed:
        tx.cumulativeWeight = calculateCumulativeWeight(tx)
    
    // Sort by weight and timestamp
    sorted = sort(unconfirmed, key=lambda x: (x.cumulativeWeight, x.timestamp))
    
    // Apply prime-based validation
    validated = []
    for tx in sorted:
        if validateWithPrimeLayer(tx):
            validated.append(tx)
    
    return validated
```

**Byzantine Agreement**
```
function byzantineAgreement(transactions):
    // Get active validators
    validators = getActiveValidators()
    
    // Calculate validator weights based on prime factors
    for validator in validators:
        validator.weight = calculatePrimeWeight(validator)
    
    // Phase 1: Propose
    proposals = {}
    for validator in validators:
        proposal = validator.proposeOrdering(transactions)
        proposals[validator.id] = proposal
    
    // Phase 2: Vote
    votes = {}
    for validator in validators:
        vote = validator.voteOnProposals(proposals)
        votes[validator.id] = vote
    
    // Phase 3: Decide
    final_ordering = aggregateVotes(votes, validators)
    
    return final_ordering
```

#### Validator Selection

**Prime-Based Selection Algorithm**
```
function selectValidator(block_height):
    // Get all eligible validators
    validators = getEligibleValidators()
    
    // Calculate selection hash
    selection_hash = hash(block_height + previous_hash)
    
    // Convert hash to selection number
    selection_num = hashToNumber(selection_hash)
    
    // Calculate total weight
    total_weight = sum(v.weight for v in validators)
    
    // Select validator using weighted random selection
    target = selection_num % total_weight
    current_weight = 0
    
    for validator in validators:
        current_weight += validator.weight
        if current_weight >= target:
            return validator
    
    return validators[0]  // Fallback
```

        addPeers(peers)
    
    // Maintain connection to at least MIN_PEERS
