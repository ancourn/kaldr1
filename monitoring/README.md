# Advanced Monitoring & Alerting Module

This module implements comprehensive monitoring and alerting for the KALDRIX blockchain DAG engine across all regions.

## Architecture Overview

### Monitoring Stack Components

1. **Metrics Collection**
   - Prometheus for application metrics
   - CloudWatch for infrastructure metrics
   - Custom business metrics exporter

2. **Log Management**
   - Fluentd for log aggregation
   - Elasticsearch for log storage and search
   - Kibana for log visualization

3. **Alerting System**
   - AlertManager for alert routing
   - PagerDuty for critical alerts
   - Slack for team notifications
   - Email for compliance alerts

4. **Anomaly Detection**
   - ML-based anomaly detection using AWS Lookout for Metrics
   - Custom anomaly detection algorithms
   - Real-time pattern recognition

5. **Business Intelligence**
   - Grafana dashboards for technical metrics
   - Custom dashboards for business KPIs
   - Real-time performance monitoring

## Multi-Region Monitoring Strategy

### Primary Region (us-east-1)
- Central monitoring hub
- Global alert management
- Master database for metrics
- Primary Grafana instance

### Secondary Regions (us-west-2, eu-west-1)
- Regional monitoring agents
- Local alert processing
- Metrics forwarding to primary
- Local dashboards for regional teams

## Key Features

### Advanced Alerting
- Multi-tier escalation flows
- Dynamic alert thresholds
- Alert suppression and grouping
- Scheduled maintenance windows

### Anomaly Detection
- ML-powered pattern recognition
- Predictive failure detection
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security anomaly detection

### Business Metrics
- Transaction throughput monitoring

- Node health and participation
- Network performance indicators

### Compliance Monitoring
- Audit trail generation
- Security event monitoring
- Performance baselining
- Regulatory compliance tracking

## Monitoring Categories

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Compute resources (CPU, memory, disk)
- Network performance and latency
- Database health and performance
- Storage utilization and I/O

### Application Monitoring
- DAG engine performance metrics
- Transaction processing rates
- Consensus algorithm health
- Peer-to-peer network metrics

### Business Monitoring

- Complete service unavailability

### High (P1)
- Regional service degradation
- Performance bottlenecks
- High error rates
- Resource exhaustion

### Medium (P2)
- Minor performance issues
- Configuration drift
- Warning threshold breaches
- Maintenance reminders

### Low (P3)
- Informational alerts
